# Facial Keypoint Detection

This project implements a facial keypoint detection system: given an image, it detects faces and predicts locations of facial keypoints on each face. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face.
Applications that use this kind of system are: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition.

This project is broken down into four main notebooks:

* Notebook 1: Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data
* Notebook 2: Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints
* Notebook 3: Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and your Trained CNN
* Notebook 4: Fun Filters and Keypoint Uses

## Local Environment Instructions

1. Install PyTorch and torchvision; this should install the latest version of PyTorch.
```
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

2. Install a few required pip packages, which are specified in the requirements text file (including OpenCV).
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
